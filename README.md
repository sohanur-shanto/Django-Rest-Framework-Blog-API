# Django-Rest-Framework-Blog-API

The internet is powered by RESTful APIs. Behind the scenes even the simplest online task involves multiple computers interacting with one another. An API (Application Programming Interface) is a formal way to describe two computers
communicating directly with one another. And while there are multiple ways to build
an API, web APIs–which allow for the transfer of data over the world wide web–are
overwhelmingly structured in a RESTful (REpresentational State Transfer) pattern.
The combination of Django and Django REST Framework is one of the most popular
and customizable ways to build web APIs, used by many of the largest tech companies
in the world including Instagram, Mozilla, Pinterest, and Bitbucket. It is also uniquely
well-suited to beginners because Django’s “batteries-included” approach masks much
of the underlying complexity and security risks involved in creating any web API.
I build out a production-ready Blog API which includes full CRUD
functionality also cover in-depth permissions, user authentication, viewsets,
routers, documentation, web tokens, json web token and more
